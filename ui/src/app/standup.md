Some observations:



·        Number of new cases declined slightly yesterday for some of the major counties (e.g. NYC, Nassau, King, Bergen, Essex, Monnmouth). I'm hesitant to read into it as it's only one day and the data is noisy. However, might be an early signal that testing backlog is beginning to decline.

·        The maps compare total confirmed cases to % increase in cases for the major hotspots. The largest % increases appear in counties just outside the hotspots. This is unsurprising, but still important for state-level workforce & resource allocation planning.

·        Upon a quick inspection, it looks like Washington, California, Louisiana, and Georgia have disproportionately high mortality for their confirmed cases. King County, WA; Orleans, LA; and Santa Clara, CA jump out especially. If helpful, we can get a deeper analysis on CFR differences across states and what that implies about total case counts.



Working to get you increasingly useful, granular analysis as Palantir gets fully brought online. Please continue to let us know what questions are most pressing, and if we should continue with these new slides (maps & mortality data).
